- Always go for the native brute force solution first (without coding) and then try to optimize and find the right solution (must).

- Communicate! Ask questions, express your thoughts and consult if necessary.

- Code for readability. Short and conside code is always good but in most cases it's better to properly structure the code using object oriented principles and correct naming. Most solutions you will find in LeetCode forums usually lack in this regard and won't pass a coding interview.
