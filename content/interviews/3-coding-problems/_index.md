When tackling a technical interview coding challenge, a systematic approach is key:

1. First conceptualize a brute force solution and explain it thoroughly without coding. This demonstrates you can reason through the problem.

2. Next, identify potential optimizations and edge cases. Consult the interviewer to validate your thinking. Communication is vital!

3. Finally, code the most optimal solution in a structured, readable style. While concise code has merits, prioritize:

- Proper object-oriented design principles 
- Descriptive variable/function names
- Modularization into helper functions 
- Comments explaining complex parts

Beware solutions online that sacrifice readability for brevity. Well-structured, easy-to-follow code that showcases your abilities is ideal for interviews.

Additional Best Practices:

- Ask clarifying questions before diving in. Validate requirements and constraints.

- Think through test cases out loud to catch edge cases early.

- Describe your approach and code aloud as you write it.

- Explain time/space complexity analysis of your solution.

- Suggest follow-up enhancements to show long-term thinking.

With care taken to communicate effectively, write readable code, and demonstrate strong CS fundamentals, you can tackle any interview coding challenge successfully. The key is staying calm, collected, and methodical in your problem solving approach.
