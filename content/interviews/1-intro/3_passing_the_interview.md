### Schedule Practice Interviews

Book two mock interviews within the next 14 days with companies you are not interested in working for. Ideally, schedule the first phone screening 7 days out. This will motivate you to prepare even when time is tight. Remember, most companies allow candidates to re-interview after 6-12 months if needed, so don't stress.

### Choose One Primary Coding Language

Although being a jack-of-all-trades with multiple programming languages is preferable on the job, it can be counterproductive in interviews. The key is optimizing the time between conceiving a solution and writing syntactically correct code. Therefore, picking a functional language you know very well is recommended.

Select the programming language you actively use and feel most proficient in as your go-to for interview coding. This ensures you can demonstrate your skills accurately.

### Other Key Strategies

- Thoroughly review the job description and research the company to anticipate likely interview questions and expectations.

- Practice discussing your resume, projects, and skills out loud to improve your articulation and confidence.

- Prepare stories that highlight times you successfully solved complex problems, overcame challenges, collaborated, etc.

- Brush up on computer science fundamentals like data structures and algorithms. Review coding patterns and syntax for your chosen language.

- Plan for behavioral and technical questions, but also prepare some insightful questions to ask the interviewer to show interest.

- Dress professionally and arrive early to interviews to make a good impression.

With practice and dedication to sharpening your interview abilities, you can showcase your qualifications persuasively and land the perfect job.
