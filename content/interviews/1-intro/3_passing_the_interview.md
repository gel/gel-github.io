### Book two practice interviews 
Those interviews must be scheduled in 14 days with companies you don’t want to work for (my suggestion is to book the first phone interview after 7 days). This will force you and your ego to prepare even when no time is available. To reduce your stress, please be aware that in most companies and in most cases you will also have a grace period of 6-12 months to try the interview again.

### Commit on one programming language
Even though in the job it’s better to be a jack-of-all-trades and know many programming languages, in an interview it is actually counter productive. The mission during preparation is to optimize and reduce the time it takes between thinking about a solution and writing it. Therefore, it is also probably better to choose a functional language.

Nonetheless, you should choose the language you actively use for programming and this should be your preferred choice.
