Making a move is also a very tough challenge which most people avoid. 

Here is a prioritized sample list of psychological reasons:
1. Fear of rejection. Imposter syndrome is the #1 reason.
2. Fear of new beginnings.
3. Lack of motivation.
4. Lack of time and power.
5. Fear of retaliation.
6. Inability to detect better opportunities.

Fortunately, none of those fears are justified and can be easily reasoned against.

## Steps

The first step in order to move is to understand the motives behind the decision. The second step is to visualize the pros and cons. Last step is compiling a decision grid and summarizing by a definite yes/no answer after consulting with trusted family, friends or trusted colleagues.

## Examples

Some personal examples 
I have are:
- Motivation to improve financially (e.g - move to a senior pay-check).
- Job is non-challenging, too boring and/or repetitive.
- Toxic organization (work-life balance, stress, inability to influence, ...).
- Bad team and leadership (not fun to work with, no-one to learn from, attrition, â€¦).

Each one of these examples can be reviewed in isolation and should be enough to make a mental decision to stay or leave.
