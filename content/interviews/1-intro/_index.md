Developing effective interview skills presents difficulties for those established in their current roles. Pursuing employment opportunities with other companies commonly necessitates substantial time and effort. However, seeking new positions while still employed offers advantages, including the abilities to:

- Negotiate improved employment agreements with greater confidence.

- Demonstrate self-assurance throughout the process.

- Provide relevant, timely examples and metrics from one's work history.

With experience transitioning between over five positions (both vertical promotions and lateral moves), I have chosen to record these steps and refine the process to benefit both myself and others.
