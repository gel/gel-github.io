Interview skills are very difficult to acquire while working in a regular day-to-day job. Therefore any attempt to be recruited by a different company will usually require massive investment of time and energy.

Unfortunately, interviewing while working is also the most preferable option. It allows you to: 

- Negotiate a better contract without fear.
- Have self confidence.
- Provide active relevant work examples and data-points.


After switching job positions more than 5 times (vertical or lateral career moves) I have finally decided to document the steps and optimize the process for myself and others.
