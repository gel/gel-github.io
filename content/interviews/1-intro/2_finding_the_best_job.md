The first thing is to understand there is no such thing as a perfect job.

In order to find the right job you first need to make sure you have enough opportunities and leads that allow you to choose the most suitable job for you.

- Invest in your LinkedIn profile and activity to be found by recruiters.
- Schedule meetings with old co-workers to see if there are unofficial opportunities.
- Talk with friends and family and announce your plans.
- Scan your network and existing company to find the companies people are moving to.
