Warning: this is a very hard read, personally I feel this book is not written in a concise and organized form.
I think the original intention is good of showing a bad software design choices and then how to fix them, but it definitely didn't transfer properly as a long software reading book.

Nonetheless, this book did change a lot of misconceptions I had in regards to architecture and tactical programming. 

If you like to suffer and learn (like me) I still advise you to take the challenge! I promise you will learn some things that will stay with you.
